I'm having difficulty with Caddy, it's sending attempts to connect via WebSockets to WordLand. It only handles HTTP.

Added new config value -- flWebsocketsIsError, defaults false. Don't want to break any apps that do handle WS requests.

I wish there were a way to configure the domains folder, but it isn't there. So I'm using a symlink.

here's the directory I want to link to

~/Dropbox/Miami/pagePark/domains

and the directory I want to link from

~/taos/pagepark/domains

apparently the command is

ln -s ~/Dropbox/Miami/pagePark/domains ~/taos/pagepark/domains

PagePark now works with specs for news products using JSON in addition to OPML.  

The data supplied is basically the same, the format is different.

An <a href="http://scripting.com/code/newsproducthome/newsscriptingcom2.json">example</a> of a JSON-spec. Also it's explained on the <a href="https://docs.feedland.dev/extras.md#json-specified-news-products">FeedLand docs</a> site. 

```javascriptconst newsProductOptions = {	urlServer: "https://feedland.com/newsproduct",	urlApp: "http://scripting.com/code/newsproducthome/index.html",	urlNewsProductSpec: "http://scripting.com/code/newsproducthome/newsscriptingcom2.json"	};options.runNewsProduct (newsProductOptions);```

The big difference is that instead of a `urlTemplate` value, there's `urlNewsProductSpec`.

Running news products for FeedLand. 

We were and still are using filter.js to hook up newsproducts via a PagePark domain. 

I wanted to simplify the connecting code and make it part of PagePark.

To invoke a newsproduct: 

```javascriptconst newsProductOptions = {	urlServer: "https://feedland.com/newsproduct",	urlApp: "http://scripting.com/code/newsproducthome/index.html",	urlTemplate: "http://scripting.com/publicfolder/feedland/products/newsScriptingCom.opml"	};options.runNewsProduct (newsProductOptions);```

This will change, as we use JSON in place of OPML for templates. 

Some of the terminology may change as well.

We can now serve from private GitHub repos. 

To do so, add an <i>accessToken</i> value to your <i>githubServeFrom</i> object in config.json.

When we get the page text from GitHub that will be in the Authorization header in the request. 

An example of a PagePark <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/3f43bd5b7b5b05dad62214102085c2aa">config.json file</a> to access a private repo via the web.

Another pagepark crash, this time on peabody, very reproducible. If you go to https://this.how/ -- it crashes. Happens in opmltojs package. I'm going to try setting up a local test and see if I can reproduce here. 

The problem was in opmltojs package, it the xml parser wasn't returning an error when it wasn't able to parse an OPML file, so I added an extra check for a null value returned, and the crash went away. 

Now it's good question why the parser couldn't handle it because it looks to be valid xml, it's the index.opml file for the this.how website.

if pagepark crashes on a machine that's running caddy, all the apps launch but the ports are already in use, so the keep launching and the machine effectively goes crazy. i found the problem by leaving a console window open, logging pagepark hits, and when the machine went nuts i scrolled back until i found the source. 

lowerhost = host.toLowerCase ()

so i check first if host is undefined and set it to the empty string.
